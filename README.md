# Machine Learning From Scratch
This repository contains Python implementations of some common machine learning algorithms. Although there are a bunch of similar repositories in GitHub, I found many of them are hard to understand and lack of optimization. The purpose of this project is to explore the inner mechanism of these algotithms.
## Getting Started

### Implemented:
* [Linear Regression](ml/linear_model/linear_regression.py)
* [Logistic Regression](ml/linear_model/logistic_regression.py)
* [Ridge Regression](ml/linear_model/ridge.py)
* [Lasso Regression](ml/linear_model/lasso.py)
* [Bayesian Linear Regression](ml/linear_model/bayesian_regression.py)
* [Decision Tree Classifier](ml/tree/decision_tree_classifier.py)
* [K Means](ml/cluster/k_means.py)
* [Gaussian Mixture Model](ml/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py)
* [K Neighbors Classifier](ml/neighbors/k_neighbors_classifier.py)
* [Naive Bayes](ml/naive_bayes/gaussian_naive_bayes.py)
* [Support Vector Classifier](ml/svm/svc.py)

### Prerequisites

What you need

```
numpy
sklearn (for test)
matplotlib (for visualization)
```

### Installing


```
$ git clone https://github.com/zhangchicheng/ML_from_scratch
$ cd ML_from_scratch
$ python setup.py install
```

## Running the tests
