# Machine Learning From Scratch
This repository contains Python implementations of some common machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this project is to explore the inner mechanism of these algotithms. Although there are a bunch of similar repositories in GitHub, I found many of them are hard to understand and lack of optimization, for example, implementing SVM without using SMO which is a very important optimization algorithm in SVM. And another reason why I do it is that I love it!
